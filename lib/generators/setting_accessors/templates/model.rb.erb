#
# This model handles the management of system wide or record specific settings
#
# @attr [String] name
#   The setting's name
#
# @attr [Object] value
#   The setting's value. May be anything that can be serialized through YAML
#
# You can access global settings just like a normal class method,
# please have a look at #method_missing for more information.
#
# If not absolutely necessary, please **do not** create settings yourself
# through Setting.new, instead use #create_or_update instead.
#
# There are also some usage examples in the corresponding test.
